Simplified Topic System - Cheat Sheet
=====================================

Create new topic branch           [shortcut: 'hg topen branchName']

  $ hg pull
  $ hg update prod
  $ hg branch IIMMDD-description  # II=initials, MM=month, DD=day
  ... not permanent until your first commit...
  
List branches, switch branch      [shortcuts: 'hg tbranches', 'hg tbranch']

  $ hg branches                   # "inactive" == in prod but still open
  $ hg branch                     # shows current branch; or "hg summary"
  $ hg update branchName          # switch branch, note cmd is "update"

Push branch to dev (or stage)     [shortcut: 'hg tpush devOrStage']

  $ hg push -b branchName dev     # add --new-branch if first time
  ...then browse to <http://branchName.dev.escholarship.org>
  ...similarly for stage

Push branch to central (for sharing or backup)

  $ hg push                       # add --new-branch if first time  

Freshen old branch with other peoples' prod changes (young branch can skip)
                                  [shortcut: 'hg tfreshen']

  $ hg pull                       # if "no changes found": ur done
  $ hg merge prod                 # if "merge w/ ancest. has no effect": ur done
  $ hg commit -m "Merging recent prod changes"
  
Push branch to production         [shortcut: 'hg tpush prod']

  $ hg update prod                # now you're on prod branch
  $ hg pull -u                    # skip if you just freshened
  $ hg merge branchName
  $ hg commit -m "Merge to prod"
  $ hg push                       # "multiple heads" failure == repeat pull/merge
  ...central will auto-update dev, stage, and production...
  $ hg update branchName          # back on your branch now

Dealing with merge conflict

  ... "merging with ancestor has no effect" == no changes, ur done
  ... if conflicts you can back out with "hg update --clean", or...
  $ hg resolve -l                 # list all files with conflicts
  ...fix fix fix...
  $ hg resolve --mark --all       # short form is "-ma"
  $ hg commit
  
Close branch                      [shortcut: 'hg tclose']

  $ hg commit --close-branch -m "Closing branch"
  $ hg push                       # auto-updates dev, stage & production

Abandon branch

  ...If never pushed to prod, just close, nobody will know ];->
  ...otherwise, make backout changeset, push...
